# Confidence Intervals for Percentiles
Percentile bounds for 1D and 2D data. 

Two types of data can be inputted. Either a single vector of data or two vectors of data. The single vector of data will use a ECDF or histogram to represent the data and give percentile bounds on that data. The two vectors of data will plot your data as x,y values and generate a circle that represents the percentile bounds of the data.
